Commissioning consists of defining, installing, creating, integrating, testing, documenting, and verifying your site and robot system. .The following sections give key points and step-by-step guidance to commission your site and robot system. {% tagref "" external_flag=true /%}

Use the commissioning checklist to keep an overview of your commissioning progress—see [Commissioning checklist](commissioning_checklist.htm).

It is the responsibility of the commissioner to draw up the Declaration of Conformity for the entire system, including any partly completed machinery and applying the CE mark to verify that the system is safe and commissioned according to regulatory standards.

Consider the following points in the process:

  * **Responsibility** : Only assigned persons should be present during commissioning. The commissioner has the main responsibility to ensure the robot is commissioned safely.

  * **Safety** : While commissioning, ensure the safety of all persons present during commissioning.

Do not load the robot, keep a safe distance to the robot, and always keep a visual of the robot in case it does not perform as expected.

  * **Requirements for robot system** : Start by clearly defining the requirements and objectives of the system. Understand the specific tasks, workflows, and challenges that the MiR robots will address.

  * **Iterations** : Commissioning is an iterative process that requires adjustments and frequent testing.

  * **Initial and final risk assessment** : Create a risk assessment of the expected solution to identify any critical safety issues. Any major changes made while commissioning must be evaluated in a new risks assessment. Always make sure that you evaluate the safety of a solution before implementing it. Conduct a final risk assessment to ensure you have implemented all relevant risk mitigation means.

  * **Integration with existing systems** : Evaluate the compatibility of MiR robots with existing systems, such as warehouse management software (WMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), or other automation systems. Ensure seamless integration to optimize overall operations. Integration-specific commissioning tasks will not be in the guide and depend on the solution and integration design.

  * **Task definition and planning** : Define specific tasks that MiR robots will perform and plan task execution. Consider factors such as task priorities, routes, and any dynamic changes in the environment that the robots need to adapt to.

  * **Mapping and navigation** : Utilize MiR's mapping and navigation capabilities by understanding how maps and zones work, creating an accurate map of the operational area, which considers dynamic obstacles and ensures efficient transportation paths.

  * **User training** : Provide comprehensive training for operators and maintenance personnel. Ensure that they are familiar with the robots, their behavioral patterns, and the basic principles for navigation and dynamic obstacles.

  * **Standalone robot** : You can use a robot in Standalone mode to create the site directly on the robot—see [Interfaces and modes](../../mirfleet/features/standalone_robot.htm). This is useful if you do not want to jump between the robot and MiR Fleet interface while creating the site.

## Desigen review 

Before implementing any robot setup, ensure that the design plans for the project have been reviewed and verified.

You can use the project design template from the MiR Support Portal to help document your project and consider all relevant points when implementing a MiR system: <https://supportportal.mobile-industrial-robots.com/documentation/commissioning-guides/project-design-review-template/>.

Store the documentation of the design review for at least 10 years and make it available upon request.

While planning your project, conduct an initial risk assessment to evaluate risks and determine suitable mitigation means.

## Checklist

Use the commissioning checklist as a guidance for the commissioning process. The list does not cover all necessary considerations to declare your installation safe and reliable. Additional items can be added based on the specific application or end user needs.
