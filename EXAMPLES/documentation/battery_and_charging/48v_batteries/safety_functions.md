﻿# Revision 2

To identify your battery version, see [Battery versions](../versions.htm).

## Overcurrent

When an overcurrent limit is exceeded, it triggers a 60 s counter, and the battery turns off temporarily. After 15 s, the battery is enabled again.

If the same overcurrent limit is triggered three time consecutivly within 60 s since the last trigger, the battery shuts down and requires intervention to recover. Host cycle the battery to bring it back to operational staten++see [Recovery from Power save mode](../battery_states/power_save.htm#Recovery2).

After recovering the battery, revise your MiR application to prevent the current limit from being exceeded again.

You can see how many times the limit has been exceeded under Monitoring > Hardware health > Battery Management System (BMS) > Overcurrent counter.
