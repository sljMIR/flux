﻿# Cable charger

The most efficient way to charge MiR robots is with MiR charging stations. Cable chargers are intended as a backup solution as they charge significantly slower than charging stations, and because they can only charge the robot's battery to 80n++90%.

When you use any of the cable chargers, make sure to:

- **Always** connect the charger to the power source before connecting the charger to the robot.

- **Always** check that the charger LED is on before connecting the charger to the robot.

- **Always** check that the battery is connected to the robot before connecting the charger to the robot.

The image shows a Battery lever used for MiR250. To connect the battery on another type of robot, see the user guide or integrator manual for your robot.

- **Always** wait 30 seconds between connecting and disconnecting the battery and vice-versa.

- **Always** check that the charger is charging the robot. You can see this by checking the LED on the charger as described in the following sections for each charger.

- **Never** operate the Battery disconnect switch or Battery disconnect lever while the robot is connected to a cable charger or charging station.

- **If relevant**, ensure the battery is within the temperature limits for chargingn++see [Electrical voltage, current, and temperature limits](../limits/current_limits.htm). Monitor the measured battery temperature under Temperature 1 and Temperature 2.

Additionally, each cable charger is designed for certain uses and should be handled differentlyn++see [Table 6.1](#Capabili). Using the wrong cable charger can damage the robot or battery. Make sure to read the following sections before using any of the cable chargers.
