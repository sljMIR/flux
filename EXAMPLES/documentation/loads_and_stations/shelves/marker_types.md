# Marker types {% tag "marker_types" /%}

A marker type is a description of a shelf that MiR robots can dock to. You must have a marker type for each type and size of shelf you want your robot to be able to transport.

A marker type is used to provide the information MiR robots need to dock to a shelf correctly. When you send the robot to a Shelf position to pick up a shelf, you must also select the marker type corresponding to the shelf.
