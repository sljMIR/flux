## Unsupported top modules

It is also foreseeable misuse to connect unsupported top modules to the robot. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Any MiR top modules that are not specifically designed for {% $model %}
* Top modules that do not meet the electrical requirements in {% tagref "electrical_interfaces" /%}
* Top modules that are not within the payload distribution described in {% tagref "payload_distribution" /%}

{% /if %}

{% if $is_forklift %}

## Unsupported payloads and handling

It is also foreseeable misuse to make the robot transporting unsupported loads or handling loads in unsupported ways. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Making the robot tow loads
* Using the robot to stack pallets or to pick up pallets from stacks
* Transporting pallets not fulfilling the technical specifications—see {% tagref "payload_distribution" /%}
